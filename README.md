# STREAM_SCoPE2_notebooks
Notebooks for applying STREAM to infer trajectory from single cell protomics data.

## Want to know more about STREAM and SCoPE2?
Details about STREAM is avaliable from Nature Communication, [ Chen H, et al. Single-cell trajectories reconstruction, exploration and mapping of omics data with STREAM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09670-4).

Details about SCoPE2 can be found on bioRxiv, [Specht, Harrison, et al. Single-cell mass-spectrometry quantifies the emergence of macrophage heterogeneity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/665307v3)

## Monocyte Differentiation sample data
In `Monocytes_Differentiation` folder, you can find one tutorial jupyter notebook, processed expression matrix `Proteins-processed.csv`, protein annotations `Cells.csv`, and a ready to used h5ad object `SCoPE2_GeneNames.h5ad`

## More sample data will be avaliable soon
